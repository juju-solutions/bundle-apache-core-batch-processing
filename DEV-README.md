# Overview

This bundle provides a complete deployment of the core components of the Apache
Hadoop platform along with its monitoring facilities.
This document describes how the components of this deployment
are connected and how to connect additional services to the deployment to add
functionality.


# Building on this Bundle

This bundle supports two ways to extend its functionality via additional charms:
by relating to the subordinate `apache-hadoop-plugin` charm, or by using a
stand-alone charm connecting to HDFS and YARN via standard relations.


## Subordinate Charm Connection

By connecting to the [plugin charm](https://jujucharms.com/apache-hadoop-plugin)
via the `hadoop-plugin` subordinate relation, a charm will get access to a
pre-configured Apache Hadoop environment, including Java libraries and the
`hdfs` command-line utility.  The `/etc/environment` file on the unit will
have all of the path and configuration variables defined.

The details of the interface protocol used by this relation are documented in
the DEV-README.md of the [plugin charm](https://jujucharms.com/apache-hadoop-plugin).

For example, to deploy [apache-hive](https://jujucharms.com/apache-hive) with
this bundle, you would use:

    juju quickstart apache-core-batch-processing
    juju deploy cs:trusty/apache-hive
    juju add-relation apache-hive plugin

This workflow has been bundled and is available as
[apache-analytics-sql](https://jujucharms.com/apache-analytics-sql).


## Stand-alone Charm Connection

If a charm does not need the Java libraries, environment config, etc., and only
needs the address information for the NameNode and ResourceManager, then it
can connect to the [hdfs-master](https://jujucharms.com/apache-hadoop-hdfs-master)
and [yarn-master](https://jujucharms.com/apache-hadoop-yarn-master) services via the
`namenode` and `resourcemanager` relations, respectively.

The details of the interface protocols used by these relations are documented
in the DEV-README.md of the respective charms.

For example, to deploy [apache-hue](https://jujucharms.com/apache-hue) with
this bundle, you would use:

    juju quickstart apache-core-batch-processing
    juju deploy cs:trusty/apache-hue
    juju add-relation apache-hue hdfs-master


# Component Services

This bundle deploys five services on a total of seven units for Apache Hadoop,
and five more services for monitoring purposes.
(for detailed information, including relation specifications,
see each charm's DEV-README.md):

* [**hdfs-master**](https://jujucharms.com/apache-hadoop-hdfs-master)
  This service runs the NameNode component.

* [**secondary-namenode**](https://jujucharms.com/apache-hadoop-hdfs-secondary)
  This service runs the Secondary NameNode component.

* [**yarn-master**](https://jujucharms.com/apache-hadoop-yarn-master)
  This service runs the ResourceManager component.

* [**compute-slave**](https://jujucharms.com/apache-hadoop-compute-slave)
  Each of the three units of this service runs both the DataNode and NodeManger components.

* [**client**](https://jujucharms.com/apache-hadoop-client)
  This service provides an endpoint from which to run jobs, whether manually or via connected services.

* [**ganglia**](https://jujucharms.com/ganglia)
  This Ganglia charm that add infrastructure monitoring.

* [**filebeat**](https://jujucharms.com/u/containers/filebeat/trusty)
  This subordinate charm collects log files from the slaves, namenode and resource manages and ships
  them to elasticsearch.

* [**topbeat**](https://jujucharms.com/u/containers/topbeat/trusty)
  This subordinate charm collects load information from the slaves ships it
  elasticsearch.

* [**elasticsearch**](https://jujucharms.com/elasticsearch)
  This service provides an full text search on the infrastructure's log information.

* [**kibana**](https://jujucharms.com/u/containers/kibana/trusty)
  This service provides Kibana that is the web interface for elasticsearch.
